2. Run *nix-build -A plutus-playground.haddock* and wait till it's done. 
3. Last line in the terminal will be output directory, something like */nix/store/bqrsjhrpiygw5f326cjmkj1g08h7y9lz-haddock-join*
4. Copy the link: file:///nix/store/6nz16h032341npjs97d93wlbx6bwfl5h-haddock-join/share/doc/plutus-ledger-api/html/Plutus-V1-Ledger-Contexts.html into your browser. 

**ScriptPurpose datatype**

- The most important purpose defined under the ScriptPurpose is the **Spending TxOutRef** in the context of the (e)UTxO model. This is when a script is run in       order to validate spending input for a transaction. 

- The second most important one is the **Minting CurrencySymbol**. It comes into play when you want to define a native token. 
  It helps describe under which circumstances in which a token can be minted or burnt. 

- The two more purposes under the ScriptPurpose datatype are the **Rewarding StakingCredential** which can be related to staking and the **Certifying Dcert**       which is related to delegating.
